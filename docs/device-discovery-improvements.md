# Device Discovery UI/UX Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced FoundDevices Component
- **Visual feedback for new devices**: New devices now have a pulsing green border and "New device - tap to setup!" message
- **Animated entrance**: Devices appear with a smooth scale/fade animation
- **Better empty state**: Shows a device icon with helpful text instead of generic "No devices found..."
- **Clearer CTAs**: Setup button is highlighted in green for new devices

### 2. Improved SearchingDeviceStep (in separate file)
- **Active scanning indicator**: Animated bouncing dots show the app is actively searching
- **Progressive help display**: Help text appears automatically after 5 seconds
- **Better help formatting**: Numbered steps with visual hierarchy
- **Time-based assistance**: More help shown after 10 seconds if no devices found

## Key UX Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy
- New devices are immediately distinguishable with:
  - Green pulsing border
  - "New device - tap to setup!" subtitle
  - Green "Setup" button

### User Guidance
- Clear scanning status with animated indicator
- Progressive disclosure of help information
- Step-by-step connection instructions with visual formatting

### Reduced Confusion
- Empty state clearly indicates devices will appear automatically
- Active scanning indicator shows the app is working
- Help text appears when users might need it most

## Implementation Notes

1. The SearchingDeviceStep improvements are in a separate component file to avoid parsing issues with special characters
2. The FoundDevices component uses Motion for smooth animations
3. Time-based help display ensures users get assistance when they need it

## Future Enhancements

1. Add a manual refresh button with cooldown timer
2. Show current network name to verify correct connection
3. Add troubleshooting for specific error states
4. Consider auto-opening device setup for single new devices (with user preference)
5. Add pull-to-refresh gesture on device list
